1. Writing a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. 
   1. This helps us check that all code changes are automatically tested when they are pushed, catching any errors early to ensure good quality through our process. Automating this step, avoids forgetfullness to test our code.
2. No because end to end tests are meant for testing the overall behavior, like how a user interests with the UI and how it responds. If we want to test a certain function, we should use a unit test.
3. navigation mode give us a simulation of the full page load whereas the snapshot gives us a specific moment.
4. First, some images are larger than they should be for display and resizing them can help with the load time, saving over 500 KiB. Next, it says we need to add a <meta name="viewport"> tag so the site can work on different screen sizes. Lastly, we could use next gen formats for images, like WebP, so we could say 165 KiB and improve page load performance.
